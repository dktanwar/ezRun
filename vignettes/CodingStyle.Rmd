```


## General Rules
Basic paradigms:

* follow the tidyverse-style: https://style.tidyverse.org/
* Use the RStudio Addin to style code: https://github.com/r-lib/styler
* Only use ascii characters in all files; neve use Umlaut and other characters
* In any file: All names and comments must be based on English

## Naming

* Use camelCase for variable names
* Use underscore_separated for function names
* recommended variable naming scheme:
** counting variables: `nSamples`, `nReads`
** use plural in vectors and matrices: `reads`



## Conventions

* use curly braces also for very simple `if` statements
* use `library` instead of `require` since `library` gives an error while `require` gives only a warning if the package is missing
* the use of row names as IDs for matrices and data.frames is fine

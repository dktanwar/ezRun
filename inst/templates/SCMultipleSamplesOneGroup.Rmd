### Unwanted sources of variation

The goal of the clustering analysis is to keep the major sources of variation in the dataset that should define the cell types, while restricting the variation due to uninteresting sources (sequencing depth, cell cycle differences, mitochondrial expression, batch effects, etc.). A common practice is to regress out these covariates prior to downstream analyses. Here, we will only asses cell cycle and batch effects as the main potential sources of variation since the method we will later use for normalization and variance stabilization removes the variation due to sequencing depth (total nUMIs per cell). While regressing out the other sources (i.e. mitochondrial abundances) has proved to have a negative impact, leading to increased correlation with covariates and decreased clustering accuracy (Pierre-Luc Germain, Anthony Sonrel, Mark D. Robinson: pipeComp, a general framework for the evaluation of computational pipelines, reveals performant single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing tools. bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.02.930578).


#### 1. Cell cycle

In most applications, the cell cycle is a minor factor of variation, secondary to differences between cell types. Any attempt at removal would also need to assume that the cell cycle effect is orthogonal to other biological processes. For example, regression would potentially remove interesting signal if cell cycle activity varied across clusters or conditions, with a prime example being the increased proliferation of activated T cells (Richard, A. C., A. T. L. Lun, W. W. Y. Lau, B. Gottgens, J. C. Marioni, and G. M. Griffiths. 2018. “T cell cytolytic capacity is independent of initial stimulation strength.” Nat. Immunol. 19 (8): 849–58.). We suggest only performing cell cycle adjustment on an as-needed basis in populations with clear cell cycle effects.
A TSNE can help us to determine whether cell cycle is a major source of variation in our dataset. 

```{r TSNE on cell cycle, fig.align='center'}
plotReducedDim(sce, dimred="TSNE_NOCORRECTED", colour_by="CellCycle", label_format = c("TSNE_1","TSNE_2"))
```

#### 2. Batch effects

On the other hand, we always look at our cells before deciding whether we need to perform integration. Te main goal of dataset integration is to identify shared cell states that are present across different datasets, in case they were collected from different individuals, experimental conditions, technologies, or even species. Large single-cell RNA sequencing projects usually need to generate data across multiple batches due to logistical constraints. This results in systematic differences in the observed expression in cells from different batches, which we refer to as “batch effects”. Batch effects are problematic as they can be major drivers of heterogeneity in the data, masking the relevant biological differences and complicating interpretation of the results.
The TSNEs and the barplot below can help us to visualize if the clusters are balanced and composed by cells from the different batches. If we see clusters that are comprised of cells from a single batch, this indicates that cells of the same type are artificially separated due to technical differences between batches. In this case, we may also consider that there are cell types that are unique to each batch. If a cluster only contains cells from a single batch, one can always debate whether that is caused by technical differences or if there is truly a batch-specific subpopulation.

}
cat("As a result, SCTransform ranked the genes by residual variance and returned the 3000 most variant genes. Next, we performed PCA on the scaled data using the previously determined variable features. Taking as a distance metric the previously identified PCs, the cells clusters were then identified using a graph-based clustering approach where the cells are embedded in a graph structure - for example a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, with edges drawn between cells with similar feature expression patterns, and then attempt to partition this graph into highly interconnected ‘communities’. The resolution is an important argument that sets the \"granularity\" of the downstream clustering and will need to be optimized for every individual experiment. Increased resolution values lead to a greater number of clusters, which is often required for larger datasets.\n")

cat("**2. Identify anchors or mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) across datasets (sometimes incorrect anchors are identified):** MNNs are like good friends.

### Cells annotation

The most challenging task in scRNA-seq data analysis is the interpretation of the results. Once we have obtained a set of clusters we want to determine what biological state is represented by each of them.
We do this using sets of marker genes that are highly expressed in each cell. This does not require matching of individual cells to the expression values of the reference dataset, which is faster and more convenient when only the identities of the markers are available. In this case, we use sets of gene markers for individual cell types taken from the CellMarkers database which contains an accurate resource of cell markers for various cell types in tissues of human and mouse (Zhang X., Lan Y., Xu J., Quan F., Zhao E., Deng C., et al. (2019). CellMarker: a manually curated resource of cell markers in human and mouse. Nucleic Acids Res. 47, D721–d728. 10.1093/nar/gky900). 
We use the AUCell package (Aibar et al. (2017) SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering. Nature Methods. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.4463) to identify marker sets that are highly expressed in each cell. AUCell uses the “Area Under the Curve” (AUC) to calculate whether a critical subset of the input gene set is enriched within the expressed genes for each cell. The AUC estimates the proportion of genes in the gene-set that are highly expressed in each cell. Cells expressing many genes from the gene-set will have higher AUC values than cells expressing fewer. Finally, it assigns cell type identity to each cell in the test dataset by taking the marker set with the top AUC as the label for that cell.

```{r AUC assigments, eval= (param$species != "other"), results='asis'}
cells_AUC <- metadata(sce)$cells_AUC
cells_assignment <- AUCell_exploreThresholds(cells_AUC, plotHist=FALSE, assign=TRUE) 
cellsAssigned <- lapply(cells_assignment, function(x) x$assignment)
assignmentTable <- reshape2::melt(cellsAssigned, value.name="cell")
colnames(assignmentTable)[2] <- "geneSet"
cat("We can explore the cell assignment results using different plots. Below, we show a heatmap that represents the number of cells (in log scale) from each cluster that were assigned to the different cell types. After calculating an AUC score for each cell and cell type, we assign cell type identity by taking the cell type with the top AUC as the label for that cell. Some cell types may be missing because no cells obtained their top AUC score for it.")
cat("\n\n")
```

tras_cells_AUC <- t(assay(cells_AUC))

tab <- table(full.labels, colData(sce)[,"seurat_clusters"])
print(pheatmap(log10(tab+10), color=viridis::viridis(100), silent=TRUE))

cat('\n')
cat("1) The distribution of the AUC values in the cells. The ideal situation will be a bi-modal distribution, in which most cells in the dataset have a low “AUC” compared to a population of cells with a higher value.  The size of the gene-set will also affect the results. With smaller gene-genes (fewer genes), it is more likely to get cells with AUC = 0. While this is the case of the “perfect markers” it is also easier to get it by chance with small datasets. The vertical bars correspond to several thresholds that could be used to consider a gene-set ‘active’. The thickest vertical line indicates the threshold selected by default: the highest value to reduce the false positives.\n")
